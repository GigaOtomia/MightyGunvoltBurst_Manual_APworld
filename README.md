# Mighty Gunvolt Burst Manual APworld
by Giga Otomia, with lots of help from the Manual APworld community.

This APworld lets you play Mighty Gunvolt Burst in an Archipelago multiworld setting. Checks and items are similar to the Mega Man 2, X, and X3 implementations, with the inclusion of Customization Points as filler items instead of health/ammo refills. Do not use the template .yaml file generated by the Archipelago launcher - use the template included here in releases instead. It has triggers that will properly hide items and checks that aren't supposed to exist. These will be updated as people play the game and report errors.
