# Mighty Gunvolt Burst Manual APworld
by Giga Otomia, with lots of help from the Manual APworld community.

This APworld lets you play Mighty Gunvolt Burst in an Archipelago multiworld setting. Checks and items are similar to the Mega Man 2, X, X2 and X3 implementations, excluding free-standing health and Customization Points, with the inclusion of Customization Points as filler items instead of health/ammo refills. Do not use the template .yaml file generated by the Archipelago launcher - use the template included here in releases instead. It has triggers that will properly hide items and checks that aren't supposed to exist. These will be updated as people play the game and report errors.

Feel free to play the game with either a completed save file or a new one. If playing with a new file, you may not have access to items the multiworld expects you to have, but logical blocks should only show up in edge cases. Worse comes to worst, simply ignore the logical requirements for one of the four items after hinting to determine that it's actually necessary. (one item in Oil Platform requires Air Action, one item on the left path in Water Works Bureau requires the Heat Element and a second item requires the ability to shoot downwards, and one item in the Mine requires both the Impact element and the ability to shoot downwards)

This APworld is intended to help its creator get 100% completion (all S-ranks and rare items) with every character on both Normal and Hard difficulties.
